# Streaming.Guru

> A movie and show streaming lookup project built with Vue and Guidebox.

Built to learn VueJS, I re-created [whatcaniwatch](http://www.github.com/matthewsecrist/whatcaniwatch) using Vue.

This version is a bit more full featured though, as it has a search option and Shows integrated in as well.
