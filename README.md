# Streaming.Guru

> A movie and show streaming lookup project built with Vue and Guidebox.

Due to Guidebox disallowing free access, this will be shut down September 1, 2017.

Built to learn VueJS, I re-created [whatcaniwatch](http://www.github.com/matthewsecrist/whatcaniwatch) using Vue.

This version is a bit more full featured though, as it has a search option and Shows integrated in as well.

## Features:

- [x] See what movies are available to stream on multiple platforms, including links to the platform.
- [x] See what shows are availble to stream on multiple platforms (links don't seem to be available from Guidebox).
- [x] Search for a specific movie or show by title.

## How to run:
* Clone it.
* npm install
* go to config/dev.env.js and add your API_KEY from [Guidebox](http://www.guidebox.com)
* npm run dev
