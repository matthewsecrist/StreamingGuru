# Streaming.Guru

> A movie and show streaming lookup project built with Vue and Guidebox.

Built to learn VueJS, I re-created [whatcaniwatch](http://www.github.com/matthewsecrist/whatcaniwatch) using Vue.

This version is a bit more full featured though, as it has a search option and Shows integrated in as well.

## Features:

- [x] See what movies are available to stream on multiple platforms, including links to the platform.
- [x] See what shows are availble to stream on multiple platforms (links don't seem to be available from Guidebox).
- [x] Search for a specific movie or show by title.

## To-do:

- [] Add actors, directors, writers pages with their attached movies and be able to search them. Right now the links just go to a broken imdb page.
- [] Easily accessible trailers for movies.
- [] Add testing

## How to run:
* Clone it.
* npm install
* go to config/dev.env.js and add your API_KEY from [Guidebox](http://www.guidebox.com)
* npm run dev
